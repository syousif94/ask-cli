We have prompt strings that looks like this:

```
log_file_name = refactor_main.md
=====

look at the following main.rs file and rewrite it into separate modules.

{{file: src/main.rs}}
```

We want to parse out anything above the ===== into a settings hashmap containing each line as a key value pair. We then want extract the string under the ===== and replace any occurance of double brackets with variables named in the double brackets.

Please write this in an example prompt_injector.rs file.
